# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
### To analyze ride sharing data in different city types by creating graphs of total weekly fares for Pyber. 

## Resources
 - Data Source: city_data_.csv, ride_data.csv
 - Software: Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and MatplotLib 3.2.2

## Results 
 - Urban ride sharing has the highest number of rides at 1,625, with 2,405 drivers. The average fare per ride is $24.53, while the average fare per driver is $16.57 for a total fare amount of $39,854.38.
 - Suburban ride sharing has the second highest amount of rides at 625, with 490 drivers. The average fare per ride is $30.97, while the average fare per driver is $39.50 for a total fare amount of $19,356.33.
 - Rural ride sharing has the lowest amount of rides at 125, with 78 total drivers. The average fare per ride is $34.62, while the average fare per driver is $55.49 for a total fare amount of $4,327.93.

## Summary
It's clear in the more populated areas, you will have more rides. However, there are far more drivers than there are rides, bringing the average fare per driver down, as shown by the urban ride sharing data. In the suburban areas, the average fare per ride and per driver increases nicely, with less drivers than there are rides. Shifting the amount of drivers to the suburbs from the urban areas would aid the supply and demand. Lastly, the urban areas have a high amount per ride and slightly more demand than supply, but doesn't warrant an immediate change.
